What is SIEM?
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It’s like a smart security system for a company’s computers and networks.

Imagine a big room with lots of computers and devices. Every device (like your laptop, printer, or server) sends out signals or messages about what’s happening—like when someone logs in, opens a file, or tries to connect to the internet.

What Does SIEM Do?
Collects Information: SIEM gathers all these messages (also called "logs") from different devices in one place.
Monitors for Problems: It watches these logs to look for anything unusual or suspicious, like someone trying to hack into the system or accessing something they shouldn't.
Sends Alerts: If SIEM finds something bad, it sends an alert to the security team, letting them know what’s happening so they can fix it.
Helps Investigate: SIEM keeps a record of all the logs. So, if a company thinks something bad happened, they can look back and see exactly what occurred.
Why Is SIEM Important?
It’s like having a security guard that watches over all the computers and networks 24/7, making sure everything is safe. And if something goes wrong, the guard sounds the alarm right away!

Example:
Without SIEM: A company might have trouble knowing if someone is trying to hack them because all their devices are sending logs separately.
With SIEM: All the information comes together in one place, making it easier to spot problems quickly.
In Summary:
SIEM helps organizations stay safe by collecting, monitoring, and analyzing all security-related activities across their computers and networks in real-time. It keeps an eye out for bad guys trying to break in!

1. DOWNLOAD THE wazuh server and wazuh agent

2. OPEN VMWARE deploy windows server 2022 and Wazuh server

3. Install Vmware tools to Windows server 2022

4. After installing the vmware tools to win server 2022 - drag the wazuh agent to windows server 2022 virtual then install

5. Login to your wazuh-server
un: wazuh-user
pass: wazuh

Type: ip addr

to get the ip address and open any browser (https://0.0.0.0)
 
GUI login
un: admin
pass: admin

6. Deploy agent 
Go to Server managemnet -> Endpoints Summary -> Click "Deploy New Agent"

SELECT WINDOWS
Server address: IP of windows server
Agent name: Agent1

COPY THE COMMANDS TO STEP 4: Run the following commands to download and install the agent:
PASTE it to windows server in CMD (powershell)

DO the same to STEP 5:Copy and paste the script to windows server cmd powershell

OPEN wazuh agent type the ip address of Wazuh server then click save  
Go to manage (CLICK start) then refresh 

7.Go back to wazuh server gui Click "close"

*****Be sure to disable Real-time Protection and Firewall on Windows Defender and any security option that may block suspicious files on your browser of choice for the testing purposes!*****

8. ENABLING FILE INTEGRITY MONITORING FOR DIRECTORIES

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a security process that checks and monitors files and directories on a system for changes, such as modifications, deletions, or additions. The goal of FIM is to detect unauthorized or suspicious activity that might indicate a security breach or malicious behavior.

How FIM Works:
Baseline Creation: FIM first creates a snapshot (baseline) of important files' current state. This includes file attributes like size, permissions, hashes (such as SHA or MD5), and more.

Ongoing Monitoring: After the baseline is set, the system continuously monitors these files and compares their current state to the baseline.

Alerting on Changes: If any unauthorized or unexpected changes are detected—such as someone modifying a file or deleting it—FIM generates an alert to notify administrators.

Common Use Cases:
Monitoring system and configuration files.
Detecting malware infections or file tampering.
Ensuring compliance with security regulations.
In summary, FIM helps to ensure that critical files remain unchanged unless authorized, providing a safeguard against cyberattacks or accidental damage.

9. Go to Windows server - open agent - click view - view config 
PASTE THIS COMMAND/SCRIPT: UNDER " \SysNative</directories> "

<directories realtime="yes" check_all="yes" report_changes="yes" recursion_level="10">c:\Users\Administrator\Downloads </directories>

THEN RESTART THE WAZUH AGENT 

TRY TO CREATE FILES IN DOWNLOADS:

GO TO WAZUH SERVER GUI - Endpoint Security - File Interity Monitoring - Change the date to TODAY

10. Integrating viruts total to detect malwares

Go to www.virustotal.com ( Create account or Login )
Click Profile - API KEY - Copy the API key 

Go to Wazuh server
Server Management - Settings - Edit Configuration
PASTE THIS TO LINE 82

<integration>
    <name>virustotal</name>
    <api_key>YOUR_API_KEY</api_key> <!-- Replace with your VirusTotal API key -->
    <group>syscheck</group>
    <alert_format>json</alert_format>
  </integration>

AND PASTE YOUR API KEY THEN SAVE AND RESTART YOUR WAZUH MANAGER

OPEN THIS LINK TO YOUR WINDOWS SERVER ( https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/ )
DOWNLOAD SOME MALWARE FOR LABS ONLY

THEN GO TO WAZUH GUI - THREAT INTELLIGENCE - THREAT HUNTING

11. INTEGRATING WINDOWS DEFENDER LOGS
Integrating Windows Defender logs in Wazuh allows you to centrally monitor, analyze, and respond to security events detected by Windows Defender across multiple systems.

Go to wazuh sever GUI

Serve management - Endpoint Groups - Click " Add new Groups " name it " windows" then save groups

Click the "windows" groups that you created - Click " Manage Agents" add the Window server endpoint

Go to FILES tab katabi ng Agent tab under windows groups - Click Edit sign of  "Agent.conf"
PASTE THIS COMMAND:

<agent_config>
<localfile>
	<location>Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational</location>
	<log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
</localfile>
</agent_config>

THEN CLICK SAVE

Go to Windows server open the Wazuh agent - Manage - Click Restart

Turn on the Windows Defender Real time Protection - Try to Download Malware from " https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/ "
It should be reporting to Wazuh server gui - ( Threat Intillegence -  Threat hunting - Change the date " Today" )

12. INTEGRATING SYSMON TO DETECT FILELESS MALWARE
Integrating Sysmon with Wazuh enables detection of fileless malware by providing detailed logs on system activity, including process creation, network connections, and in-memory code execution. Fileless malware typically operates in memory, avoiding traditional file-based detection. Sysmon captures in-depth behavioral data, which Wazuh can analyze for suspicious patterns indicative of fileless attacks. 

Go to Windows server open browser download this " https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon " then extract on the same directory

Go to this link " https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config " click the cod ( green color ) then click Download - Also extract afte downloading

Open the folder " sysmon-config master " copy all the files then paste it to  " Sysmon Folder "

Then Open CMD PowerShell - go to the directory of " sysmon folder " ( C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Sysmon ) then paste this command to CMD Powershell ( .\sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xml )
